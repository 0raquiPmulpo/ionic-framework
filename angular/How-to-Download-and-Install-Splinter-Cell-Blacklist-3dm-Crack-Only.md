## Gameplay Tips for Splinter Cell Blacklist

- Use the Strategic Mission Interface (SMI) to access the main campaign missions, the 4th Echelon missions, and the Spies vs. Mercs mode. You can also customize your loadout, upgrade your gear, and check your stats and challenges from the SMI.
- Choose your playstyle according to your preference and the situation. You can play as a Ghost (stealthy and non-lethal), a Panther (stealthy and lethal), or an Assault (loud and lethal). Each playstyle has its own rewards and challenges.
- Use the Selection Wheel to quickly switch between your weapons and gadgets. You can also use it to activate special abilities such as Mark and Execute, which allows you to mark up to three enemies and take them out with one button press.
- Use your gadgets wisely to distract, disable, or eliminate your enemies. Some of the most useful gadgets are the Tri-Rotor Drone, which can scout ahead and fire sleeping gas or shock darts; the Sticky Shocker, which can electrocute enemies from a distance; and the Sticky Camera, which can provide surveillance and emit noise or gas.
- Use your environment to your advantage. You can hide in shadows, climb on pipes, rappel on walls, slide under obstacles, and use cover to avoid detection or engage in combat. You can also interact with objects such as doors, switches, computers, and vents to create diversions or access new areas.
- Play co-op with a friend or a random partner to complete 14 additional missions that are separate from the main campaign. You can choose between two characters: Sam Fisher or Isaac Briggs. Each character has different abilities and equipment that complement each other.
- Play Spies vs. Mercs mode to compete against other players online in two teams of four. Spies are agile and stealthy but have weak weapons and armor. Mercs are slow and loud but have powerful weapons and gadgets. The objective is to hack or defend terminals depending on your team.
